This workshop will explore how next-generation smart robots are driving the evolution of Industry 5.0 by bringing humans back to the center of industrial production through effective human-robot collaboration. 
Moving beyond safety certification and simple coexistence, the workshop will delve into cutting-edge advances in perception, control, and motion planning that are crucial for deploying collaborative robots in real-world industrial environments.

The program will feature keynote talks by established researchers, innovative startup founders, and experts from industrial-focused research centers, providing a rich blend of academic insights and industry-driven perspectives.
Topics will include:

.. - Stability and passivity for safe robot control in physical human-robot interaction
.. - Human-aware motion prediction and planning for shared workspaces
.. - Shared autonomy and adaptive control to balance human expertise with robotic consistency
.. - Learning from demonstration to boost productivity and flexibility on the factory floor
.. - Advanced sensing systems and algorithms for smart manufacturing
.. - Reinforcement learning and large behavioral models for next-generation task planning and allocation

- advanced sensing systems and algorithms for smart factories;
- safe robot control in physical human-robot interactive tasks;
- shared autonomy and adaptive control to balance human expertise and robotic consistency;
- human-aware motion prediction and planning in collaborative and cooperative environments;
- learning from human demonstration to enhance productivity and flexibility;
